# Rock Paper Scissors Game
 https://basantae.github.io/RockPaper-Scissors-Game/
A simple and fun Rock-Paper-Scissors game built with JavaScript that lets you challenge the computer and test your luck!

## How It Works (Logic Flow)

- User clicks one of the choices: **rock**, **paper**, or **scissors**.  
- The click listener captures the user's choice and calls the `playGame` function.  
- `playGame` generates a random computer choice using `genCompChoice`.  
- Both choices are compared:  
  - If the same, it's a draw (`drawGame` function).  
  - Otherwise, classic rules apply:  
    - Rock beats scissors  
    - Paper beats rock  
    - Scissors beat paper  
- The winner is decided and `showWinner` updates the scores and displays the result.  
- Scores increment as appropriate and messages update dynamically.  
- The game continues with each user click for endless fun!

## Features

- Interactive gameplay with real-time updates
